# PET-IEEE-488-Extension
This is a splitter and cable adapter for the Commodore PET IEEE-488 edge connector port. It can serve for connecting a "cheap" standard IEEE-488 cable with both sides IEEE-488 connectors to the edge connector IEEE-488 port of the PET. The original cables with an edge connector are a fortune nowadays.
